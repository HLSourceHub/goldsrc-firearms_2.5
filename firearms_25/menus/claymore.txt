M18A1 Claymore
The M18A1 Claymore device is both an offensive and defensive
explosive. It works by igniting a layer of C4 that sends hundreds 
of tiny pellets into its blast area. Note: After planting 
the Claymore, a plunger will come up. Primary Fire with
the plunger will cause you to detonate it. Alt-fire will cause the 
Claymore to go into "trip mode".

Costs 5 credits.
