40mm GL
The 40mm GL is a relic from a past conflict. It still sees action
in other countries and areas, but most militaries that use it are
technologically inferior. It was designed to give the infantry
man the power to offer a special type of fire support in battle.
The 40mm GL is a breach loader and fires 40mm High Explosive
grenades at great distances.

Costs 9 credits.
