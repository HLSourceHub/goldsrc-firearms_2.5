Quick Config Token List
By Eric PL Smith (kncogs@xmission.com)

The following is a list of the valid tokens that can be placed in the “quick config.txt”
file to be loaded from the Configurations menu by clicking the “Quick Config” button.
This file is fully customizable.

The _armor tokens are required to lead the rest of the configuration tokens.  They are
the tokens that determine the amount of credits that the rest of the configuration will
use to buy the items that follow not to include skill tokens.  Putting these tokens
anywhere in the file but at the beginning of your desired configuration, will cause all
items above this token to be discarded.  The 3 valid _armor tokens are:

	light_armor
	medium_armor
	heavy_armor

The rest of the item tokens do not have to be in any particular order but they must be in
the order that you would like them to be purchased in.  If there are not enough credits
available to make the desired purchase it will be discarded and the next token will be
evaluated.  The valid item purchase tokens are:

	armor_helmet
	armor_arms
	armor_legs
	frag
	flashbang
	stg24
	claymore
	bandages
	acpsa
	rvsascp
	sa3rb
	sasil
	aesa
	tac12
	autoshot
	9mmlc
	tacsmg
	bfsmg
	akimbo
	hcmsmg
	arbt
	artac
	tacarlcm
	natoarscp
	argl
	carbine
	bparscp
	srscp
	atsrscp
	hcmmg
	40mmgl

The skill tokens can be placed anywhere in the file you desire and must be placed in the order that you would like them to be chosen.  When a skill token is chosen, you will be
charged for the skill, the skill will be given and the next token will be evaluated.
If the skill is already chosen, then the token will be discarded but you will still be
charged for the skill.  All minor skills must precede its major skill.  For instance, 
you can’t have Field Medicine before First Aid, Artillery II before Artillery I or 
Marksmanship II before Marksmanship I.  Otherwise you will be charged for the skill 
but the skill will be discarded.

It is recommended that you keep all 10 skills tokens in this file regardless of  the
servers “sv_useskills” setting.  Although you will probably not be able to obtain all
skills, the purpose is that so that if you have the skill points available, then skill 
purchasing will proceed in order until all your available skill points are spent.  The 
amount of skill points are determined by the server setting.  If on a “sv_useskills 0” 
server, all skill tokens will be discarded.  On a “sv_useskills 1” rank advance server,
you will earn a skill point at time of rank advance with 1 automatic skill point on
server join.  A “sv_useskills 2” server will award you 4 skill points to spend regardless
of rank.  On a “sv_useskills 3” server, all skill tokens are discarded because you have
all skills to begin with.  The following tokens are the valid skill tokens:

	marksmanship1
	marksmanship2
	nomenclature
	battlefield_agility
	leadership
	first_aid
	field_medicine
	artillery1
	artillery2
	stealth
