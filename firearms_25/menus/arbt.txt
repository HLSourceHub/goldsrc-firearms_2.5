AK-47
The 7.62MM AR-BT is a sturdy weapon. Built soon after World
War 2 by a tank mechanic, it soon became the standard issue
for many armies across the world. Its sheer availability has
given it great power. It fires 7.62mm rounds with a good rate
of fire, and with good accuracy. A soldier's weapon, it is
mounted with a bayonette for close combat.

Costs 12 credits.
