7.62 HCM-MG
The 7.62 HCM-MG machine gun has its roots in the BAR of World
War II. Designed to give the infantry man the power of a heavy
machine gun, the firearm fires a 7.62mm round and uses the
ammo in the form of belts.  This weapon was not designed to be
fired from a standing position and is most useful and more
accurate if placed on a solid object such as the ground while
prone.

Costs 19 credits.
