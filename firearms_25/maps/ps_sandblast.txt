Sandblast (Push)

 By Jeff Lane

Each team must try to capture all three checkpoints of the
map in sequence. Once your team captures all check points,
all players respawn. For capturing all points, each team member
gets 8 points, the scoring player gains an additional 4 points,
and team's reinforcements increase by 10.

Additionally, capturing the center checkpoint gives 3 points
to the capturing player.
