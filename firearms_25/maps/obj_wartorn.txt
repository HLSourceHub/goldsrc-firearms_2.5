Wartorn (Objectives)

 By Tyler Munden

Objective : Each team has a keycard somewhere
in the city. You must find your enemy's keycard
and use it to gain entrance to the SAM site. 
The blue force must activate the site to ward 
off the red airstrike, while the red force must 
deactivate the site so that more reinforcements 
can fly in. Once you enter the SAM site, you 
must capture the site's control room.
