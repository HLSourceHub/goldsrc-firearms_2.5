CTI/Seek'n'Destroy/Push :)
by [WTF?]CrowbarSniper

Blue team has taken over a small 
town and is using it as an ammo 
supply depot.  Red team, you will 
be dropped off outside make your
way through and destroy the ammo 
stores (using Claymores).

Blue defend your ammo stores 
("firearms" squares on ground) 
at all costs, and get the sacred 
menkey statue to the truck Red 
is guarding.

A small bonus will be awarded
for controlling various parts of 
the town (via the 'push' flags).

Good luck.
