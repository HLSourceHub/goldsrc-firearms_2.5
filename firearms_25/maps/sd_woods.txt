Woods (Seek & Destroy)

 By Rob Lutz

Destroy the ammo and supply crates on the enemy
side of the woods. Red has metal crates.  Blue has
wooden crates. Defend your own crates as well as
destroying the enemy's crates for points. Points
given according to the crate's distance into the
enemy base.

All crates must be destroyed with a Claymore 
mine explosive.
